# Human1 for graph databases
[Human1](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/bio/news/Pages/The-next-generation-of-human-metabolic-modelling.aspx) is a very recent synthesis of two landmark human metabolic networks:

 - [recon2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4896983/)
 - [Recon3D](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4072)
 
This repo translates Human1's SBML distribution into flat tsv files which can be used to fill
databases.  Our emphasis at present is on filling to <b><i>graph</i></b> databases, neo4j and the google
biomedical data commons.

This first version is, of course, only preliminary.  Expect changes in the next few days and weeks.

## An SBML entry for one reaction

 - <b>firstExperiments/readSBML.R</b> parses the xml into R data structures
 - <b>firstExperiments/toTSV.R</b> writes them out in language-neutral tab-delimited text
 - <b>firstExperiments/import/loadAll.cypher</b> loads these structures into a neo4j graph database
 - expect schema revisions as we work with - start to query - these data

## The tab-delimited files (see firstExperiments/import/*.tsv).

#### The entities:

  - <b>reactions.tsv</b>:  very simple, just an id and some chemical attributes
  - <b>metabolites.tsv</b>: called "species" by human1
  - <b>genes.tsv</b>:  called "geneProducts" by human1, these are the enzymes in the reaction
  - <b>groups.tsv</b>: roughly speaking, these are pathways

#### Their relationships:

  - <b>reactantRoles.tsv</b>:  relationship between substrate metabolites and their reactions
  - <b>productRoles.tsv</b>:  reactions and the metabolites they produce
  - <b>geneRoles.tsv</b>:  which genes (enzymes) participate in which reactions
  - <b>groupMemberships.tsv</b>: non-overlapping assignment of reactions to groups (~pathways)

## The SBML of one reaction record (with most namespaces removed):
